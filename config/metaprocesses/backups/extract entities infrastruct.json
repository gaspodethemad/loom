A prototypical example:\n```{{\n\"<entity name>\": {{\n\"type\": \"<entity type>\",\n\"desc\":\"<description>\"\n}}\n}}\n```\nReturn only this Python dictionary, no talk or comments of any kind, as your answer will be immediately processed by a Python function (much less intelligent than yourself), and we don't want it to crash:n\n{x}\n\n[assistant](#message)\n\"\"\"",
