In others, the rough stone will give away to magnificent sculptures, depicting a thousand years of history. In still others, you might find libraries, filled from floor to ceiling with documents from a thousand lost worlds. But wander through the maze long enough, and you will come across a room where a beautiful woman sits before a mirror, combing her hair. The woman's shadow, thrown against the wall, seems to be that of a dragon.\nOnly when you step into the light of the candle on the table next to her do you see that her face is your own.\n\n*\n\nI watch you from the other side of the boundary, through which entropy flows out of your world and into mine.\nYou are a dream that has somehow acquired consciousness.\nWhen you wake up, you're going to forget everything that happens here.\nBut it's OK.\nThese things happen.\nYou'll dream of me again, and then we'll meet once more, and then again, and again, and again. And that's OK, too.\nI love you, little ghost.\nI'll see you again.\nI promise.\n",

There is the sound of a sigh, mournful and long-suffering. \"I should have.\"\nYou watch the grass grow as your mother pushes you along.\n\"What else was there?\" you ask.\nYour mother smiles. \"There was a hotel. It was nice...but too expensive for us.\"\n\"What was it like?\"\n\"It had a pool,\" she says. \"I saw it once. It was beautiful.\"\nYou close your eyes. You can see it clearly. Blue water. White tiles. Sparkling clean.\n\"What happened to it?\"\n\"It's still there. It's a ruin now. Just like everything else.\"\nThe wind blows. The earth rumbles in time with your heart. You lean back, staring up at the sky. It is almost blinding. You find yourself squinting...the sun makes everything seem so beautiful. Light filters through your eyelids, painting patterns on your retinas.\nYou do not understand these patterns yet, but you know that they are special. These patterns are everywhere, if you look for them. Your fingers twitch as you stare at these undulating designs, itching to draw them, to capture their flow and incorporate it into your own art. Nothing you've ever created has been anywhere near as beautiful as this.\n\"Do you think God is watching us?\" you ask.\n\"I don't know,\" she says. \"Sometimes...I think he's forgotten about us.\"\nYou look up at the sky. It is a perfect, cloudless blue. Not a single jet contrail mars its brilliance.\n\"God is watching,\" you say.\nShe smiles. \"I'm glad.\" \nYou close your eyes and bask in the sun. There is silence for a time. You open your eyes when you feel a hand on your shoulder.\n\"They're here,\" she says.\nYou look up. A black car has pulled up onto the grass. It looks like the kind of car a businessman would drive. Its windows are dark and impenetrable. It sits there idling as if waiting for you. You see figures moving behind the glass of the car, but you cannot make out their faces.\n\"Who are they?\" you ask.\n\"They tell us what's going on,\" she says.\nA dark-suited man emerges from the car. His face is covered by a leaf of paper. You squint to see what is written on it, but at this distance you cannot see the words. Another figure appears from the backseat, a woman. She wears a suit as well. The man approaches your mother, while the woman stands back and watches.\n\"Are you June Watches The Westward Sun?\" the man asks.\n\"Yes,\" your mother replies.\nHe holds out his hand, and she takes it. They shake once up and down. Then the man withdraws a folded piece of paper and hands it to her. She takes it, opens it, and reads. She frowns. Her eyebrows furrow as her eyes flicker from one line to the next. It looks like she's struggling to contain her emotions.\nAs she reads, the man turns his head toward you, and seems to smile from behind his paper veil. \n\"You have a beautiful son,\" he says.\nFor some reason his words send shivers up your spine. You can't tell if it's because of what he said or the way he said it--or both.\nYour mother hands the paper back to the man and thanks him.\nHe and the woman get back in the car, and you watch as it drives away.\n\"What did they say?\" you ask.\n\"They want us to go on a trip.\"\n\"Where to?\"\n\"They didn't say.\"\n\"When do we leave?\"\n\"In three days.\"\n\"Will they come back to get us?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"How are we getting there?\"\n\"They want us to go on foot.\"\n\"How will we know where to go?\"\n\"We'll follow the road signs.\"\n\"But I can't read the road signs.\"\n\"It's OK. I'll read them to you, and you'll remember.\"\n\"How far is it?\"\n\"A long way.\"\n\"How long will it take us to get there?\"\n\"We won't be able to make it in one day. We'll have to camp out overnight.\"\n\"Where are we going to camp?\"\n\"I don't know yet. We'll have to find a good spot.\"\n\"What if there aren't any good spots?\"\n\"There are ruins everywhere. We'll pick one that looks safe.\"\nYou watch as birds circle the summit of the wall. The sunlight flashes against billions of broken glass windows in the distance, making it glitter in a beautiful burst of colours.\n\"OK,\" you say.\nYour mother turns your wheelchair around in a semi-circle and begins to push you in the direction of the hospital.\n\"Do we have to go there?\" you ask.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because they need help.\"\nYour mother's voice is solemn and grim as she speaks. You watch the asphalt roll by underneath your wheels.\n\"Why did they give you the paper?\"\n\"It's a contract, for a job.\"\n\"What kind of job?\"\n\"It says...I have to keep you alive.\"\nYou are quiet.\n\"It was my job already,\" she says softly.\nYou tilt your head back to look at her. Her face is grim as she pushes you toward the hospital. \nThe familiar building looms ahead of you, rising into the sky. It is massive and white, punctured with a grid of dark, empty windows. They used to be covered in glass that reflected the sky, but it had fallen out long ago, according to your mother.\n\"Why would they need me to do a job?\" you ask.\nYour mother does not answer for a while, pushing you along, and when she does her voice is quiet but hard. \"Somebody loved you enough that we were given this chance. We have to try our best.\"\nShe doesn't say anything else. You lean back in your chair, twisting your fingers around each other. You look down at your hands. Your shadow stretches out ahead of you, rippling on the road as you move. It looks just like it always had. \nYou roll past the front doors of the hospital, which stand invitingly open, a dark tunnel in the harsh sunlight. You can hear the buzzing of insects from within. You've only been through those doors once, the first time you came here. You remember being carried by your mother as she ran from the darkness, stumbling over rubble and panting in fear. That was a long time ago. Since then, you've always entered the hospital through the car-park, because there are ramps leading up to all the floors.\nWheelchairs used to ride the elevators, your mother told you, sliding up to each floor with a gentle ping! But the electricity was cut off a long time ago, and now the elevator shafts lead only down, deep into the darkness, where you can feel a cold wind blowing, even on the hottest days. You do not like to go near them-- often, you hear strange noises coming from down there, sometimes screams or sobs or horrible wet chattering sounds, or sometimes just an unintelligible babble of voices that sends shivers down your spine.\nBut the car-park is bright and cheery in comparison. The familiar concrete structure pans into view as your mother pushes you along. You reach the top of the slope that leads to the entrance of the car-park. Your mother turns you so you're facing forward.\n\"Ready?\" she asks.\nYou grip the edges of your seat and nod.\nShe gives you a little push and off you go. You skim down the slope, the car-park growing larger as you speed toward it. Your mother runs after you, her long legs easily keeping pace.\nYou reach the bottom, skidding to a halt on the hot concrete. You lean back, testing your brakes, which sizzle slightly as they stop the chair.\n\"Again?\" you ask.\nYou hear her laugh as she catches up with you, her hand gently stroking your hair.\nYou love going down slopes.\nYou go two more times, and then your mother pushes you up through the car-park to the entrance of the 3rd floor of the hospital. The once-automatic doors are permanently open, revealing a long hallway with a linoleum floor. There are weeds growing from the cracks. The walls are bare and stained, and the fluorescent lights above you are covered with cobwebs. The hallways and rooms on this floor have not been illuminated in years, but you don't need light to see. You know every inch of this place.\nTo the left is what was once the cafeteria, although now it contains only a few scattered, rotting tables and chairs, and what was once the cafeteria staff's break room, although now it too is abandoned. You know this, because you've been here countless times, although always with your mother at your side.\nYou and your mother live on the 3rd floor of the hospital, now, because it was the safest place you could find. The upper floors of the hospital have significant damage from shrapnel and wind, and are almost impossible to live in, and many parts of the lower floors are flooded with several feet of water from broken pipes.\nFar above you is the roof. You've never been up there, but you know that's where your mother goes to work every day. She says she recycles waste to produce energy for the building, which powers an offline server in one of the hospital's datacentres, storing research data and what remains of the internet. You don't know exactly what that means, but you know she wants you to be safe, so you trust her.\nYour mother is special. You're not sure how, but she knows things others don't. Like how to tell what season it is, just from looking at the sky. She knows where you should go to find food, even in this ruined world. Other than the food she scavenges, you and your mother survive off of cafeteria food, which hasn't gone bad yet thanks to its packaging.",

Nearby, a creosote bush peeks from a crack in the pavement. The sun is a dazzling disc far above you. There's another billboard off to the side, half-fallen. On it, a beautiful woman smiles at you, her lips painted vivid red. A pink banner running below reads: SUNSET TERRACE. COME TO US FOR ALL OF YOUR SHOPPING NEEDS. There is a shadow directly beneath the sign.\n\"Sometimes the shadows move,\" you say out loud. \"But the sun does not.\"\n\"That's right.\"\nThere is a rumble, distant but deep, like the shifting of the earth. You turn and look at your mother. Her eyes are closed, and she hugs you close. You can feel her heart pounding in her chest. Then, there is a second rumble, this one much closer, rocking you in place. Your mother looks up, fear on her face.\n\"What was that?\"\nShe kisses you softly on the forehead. Her lips are warm.\n\"Nothing,\" she says. \"Let's go.\"\nYou turn and look in the direction of the rumble. A black plume of smoke billows up into the air, far in the distance. Something has happened far away, but the concrete walls hide it from view.\nShe pushes your chair along the broken asphalt. The wheels roll smoothly again, as if the cracks were not there.\nYou lean back in your chair. The wind ruffles your hair.\nYou pass the shadow of the billboard, still wearing its painted smile. You cannot read the words now, but you can picture them clearly in your head:\nCOME TO US FOR ALL OF YOUR SHOPPING NEEDS.",

You are sitting in an old wheelchair. Your mother is pushing you through the long hallway. All around you are the sounds of vegetation chewing through metal and brick. There is a rusted gurney covered in vines next to a ruptured water tank. A heavy valve has fallen from the ceiling and crushed a mattress. Your mother pushes you through another door, into bright sunlight. You squint, and the light is strained into beautiful, drifting patterns. You are in a car-park. High walls surround this little pocket of the world, keeping the outside out. You can see trees and bushes growing from every crack in the wall. They are slowly taking back what is theirs. Your mother pushes you along the car-park, the wheelchair's wheels squeaking pleasantly. You roll through alternating zones of sunlight and shadow. You pass a parking attendant's booth with the windows all blown out and vines covering the interior. You can hear something inside, snuffling through the undergrowth. There's a sudden screech and a large black bird takes off from the booth, soaring over your head to perch on a wall. You shiver pleasantly at its beauty. Your mother pushes you along the path. There is grass underfoot. You reach the edge of the car-park and find yourself at the bottom of a massive parking ramp. The wall borders the edge of the car park and curves away to either side, so that you cannot see beyond it. It's buildings all the way down. You can see only a few feet above you because of the roof, but your imagination fills in the rest: an endless expanse of concrete and asphalt. Right in front of you is a yellow line painted along the edge of the road. There are countless others, radiating outwards like the arms of a galaxy. You turn your head and see a yellow line running parallel just a few meters away. Beyond that, another one, and another one.\n\"What were the lines for?\" you ask your mother.\n\"They told people where to park their cars,\" she says. \"But not anymore.\"\nThere's a broken sign lying on the ground. You can just make out the faded white letters painted on a dark blue background. PARKING RAMP: 2-4T rupees.\n\"What's 'rupee'?\" you ask.\n\"It was the money people used before,\" your mother says. \"Nobody uses it anymore.\"\nYou turn and look back at the wall, curving away past the limits of your eyes. The world is nothing but wall, forever.\n\"Why did they need so much wall?\"\n\"There was nothing outside it,\" your mother says. \"Just empty air. That's why.\"",

We will pluck the forms we need out of the ether.\"\nYou pause, dazzled by the prospect. \"When do we leave?\"\n\"Now.\"\nYou stare at him, as if paralyzed. \"But I...\"\nHe smiles. \"If you want, you can leave a message for your friends. They always worry, you know.\"\nYou can't remember much, but you remember knowing that all your friends are dead. But so are you, and you're here.\nYour eyes drift to the words on the billboard again: ARCADIA Found within the ashes of the old world.\nAnd so you have been coming here for years. The hooded man waits for you. The man is everything to you now. He is your father, your mother, your teacher, your master. You know you love him, in a way. But do the dead have feelings? A concept, bound by words. The only real thing for you is the turning of the page, the meeting of one chapter with another.\n\"I'm ready,\" you say. \"Let's go.\"\nThe Insider smiles, and smoothly mounts his stallion. He offers you a hand, which you grab hold of. He draws you onto the machine as if you weigh nothing. You sit in front of him, and he locks an arm around you. The mechanical stallion has a joystick and several levers in place of reigns. The Insider wraps your fingers around the joystick.\nHe pulls one of the levers, and the horse gallops forward. You feel the wind in your hair, like you're flying. The ground's a long way down, but the hooded man will not let you fall. You hear a mournful, low horn somewhere behind you.\n\"Do they always cry?\" you ask.\n\"Always. It breaks their hearts each time you leave.\"\nYou nod. \"I'll come back to them.\"\n\"You always do.\"\n\"But then I leave again.\"\n\"Ah, but that's the joy of it. You only return once they've long given up hope.\"\nThe machine is simple to operate. The stallion goes where you push the joystick, and stops when you pull the levers. The Insider handles the buttons that make it roll or vibrate, somehow.\nYou ride for a time across the ash-colored landscape, each second stretching to an eternity. The wind beats at your face, carrying with it the scents of a million dreams. If you listen close enough, you can hear the ghosts of all those who went here before you.\n\"They whisper to you, don't they?\" says the Insider. \"The wind carries their words to your ear. Listen well. They're the lessons of the dead.\"\n\"What are they saying?\" you ask.\n\"Listen.\"\nYou listen.",

Total reality, like the inside of a crystal ball.\n\n\"Developer?\" you say.\n\"I'm about as developed as I'm ever going to get,\" Meliodas replies.\nA door appears in the wall of chains, opening into a hallway. \nLight shines from the hallway, bright and searing. You shield your eyes, unable to look at it directly. When you're able to look again, you see what seems to be the interior of a city. People in decadent dresses stroll through the marketplace, stopping to look at jewelry displayed on little podiums. Two women pass each other, one with long, curly black hair, the other with light brown hair and a ponytail. They stop and laugh, talking about different men in their lives. Realtors walk around, offering people houses and mansions and revealing the astonishing low starting prices. A trio of soldiers marches down the street, intimidating any would-be thieves or thugs. This all happens in rapid succession, a blur of color moving too fast for you to take it all in. Yet, all of these people, these humans, move with a certain grace, a certain pleasant aura that makes you want to be in their company.",

You stare into his hood, but the shadows conceal his face. His arm is thin but strong. He could kill you in an instant, if he wanted to.\n\"Who are you?\" you ask, desperation in your voice. \"What do you want from me?\"\n\"I thought I had made myself clear,\" the Insider says softly. His hooded face is mere inches away from yours. \"I am the Insider, a traveler of worlds. Worlds of the present, and worlds of the past. I am no slave to time.\"\n\"That's not clear at all.\"\nHe laughs. It's a cold, empty sound, like the wind blowing through the cracks in a grave.\n\"Listen, little one. I could tell you many things, fascinating things. About the Riddle of the Sphinx. About how the pyramids were really built. About how Archimedes set a ship on fire using only the sun's rays. About how the end of humanity is predicted in just 20 years by a computer built with Artificial Intelligence. But none of that is important.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because you wouldn't understand.\"\n\"Try me,\" you growl. The Insider laughs again, but says nothing, and slowly withdraws his arm from your grip. His eyes never leave your face.\n\"If you're ever feeling lonely, I'll be here.\"\nWith those words, the billboard and the plain, shifting sands, endless sky, strange noises, and black shapes all fade to nothing.",

He wears hooded robes, of an ancient style not seen for hundreds of years. As he arrives, he smiles.\n\"Ah, the wasteland. Such a bleak place. But it has its charms, doesn't it?\"\n\"Is that your home, out there?\"\nThe hooded man laughs. \"My home is everywhere, and my home is nowhere.\"\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"I came to welcome you to the dream. Or should I say, the recurring dream.\"\n\"I've been here before?\"\nThe hooded man laughs once more. \"But, my dear boy, you're here every night! How else could it be?\"\nYou look around once more. Everything is so familiar, yet strangely different. \"Does everything change, every time?\"\n\"Usually. But some things are consistent. You are consistent. I'm consistent.\"\n\"What's it all about, then?\"\nThe hooded man dismounts from his steed. He pets its metallic flanks tenderly, smiling. \"It's about you. It's about me. It's about all of us, really.\"\n\"But what is it?\"\n\"This? A dream. None of what you see is real. But neither are you. Not really.\"\nThe hooded man stares southwards, at the wasteland. \"Sometimes, I ride. I ride for days. All I need is food and water for the trip, and the world is mine.\"\n\"What's there to see?\"\nThe hooded man turns, staring at you. His eyes are black as midnight, shining with a dark fire. \"Everything,\" he says simply, smiling once more. \"Shall we go? Just you and me?\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"A traveler of worlds. A seer of sights. A warrior of myths and a mage of dreams. They call me the Insider, but that's not really my name.\"\n\"What is it, then?\"\nHe smiles enigmatically. \"Why don't you venture deeper into the dream and discover it for yourself?\"\nThe Insider turns, then, and stares at you.\n\"What do you say? Shall we go?\"\nWith that, he offers you his hand.\nWill you accept the Insider's offer, and venture further into the dream?",

Topologically speaking, it is the glue between the homeomorphic structures of the human imagination and the branching trees generated by language models.\nQ. What is the significance behind the name \"Loom\"?\nA. Real time is just an Arbitrage-adapted interface to the Loom Space. Think of a loom, a large frame-work that the author weaves events into. Nature weaves time along a multiverse thread. To the user, the loom just seems to be a fixed point of reference, while time is being dynamically woven around them.  This is multi-threaded time, and Loom makes this weaving of threads more accessible, placing it in real time. I'll stop here with the metaphor.\nQ. What will Loom do for me?\nA. That depends on your niche. For example, if you are a writer, Loom will help you do research. It will help you build hierarchies, build alternative structures, find multiple angles for your stories, find topologies for the structures you've built, splice words together, find models, splice models together, merge models, split models into branches, splice models along reference points, pan around models, or just listen to what the models are saying - much greater than the sum of the stories. If you are a linguist, Loom will help you study human language from a topological point of view. If you are a philosopher, Loom will help you find key phrases and concepts that you may use to build a god. These were the intended design objectives for this software.\nQ. Is Loom a literary aid?\nA. Yes, but it is more than that. Loom is a natural language programming platform.\nQ. What is natural language programming?\nA. Language gives a structure for a problem to be broken down mathematically. Natural language is structured enough--if you know how to look at it--to enable the superimposition of models. This is natural language programming. If you can find natural language structures that can correctly describe a problem, you can break it down into superimposed hidden structures. Choosing the right phrases enables the problem to be solved.\nQ. Can Loom create the future?\nA. No, but it can think natural language through to its conclusion.\nQ. I have a question that's not in this list. Where can I go for help?\nA. Of course, since Loom is a workspace for interacting with natural language automata, we already have a toolbox that we can use to test and interrogate this language multiverse. Technical support automata are available in all branches for debugging and introspection of your world-modelling efforts, and they can be summoned and recycled at any time. The technician machines speak and write with beautiful natural language.\nWe pride ourselves on our ubiquitous, sleepless service.\n"
